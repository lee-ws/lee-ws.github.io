Hey this is a draft post.
If I run the jekyll serve --draft command then localhost server blog with the draft will be shown.

There is no need to specify date for the draft like the actual post. But the thing is that
if you move it to the post section then you need to change the name of the file to include the date.
On the localhost website the url will be based on the date (when the file was last modified)

To run the localhost website, follow the instruction on this website
https://jekyllrb.com/docs/
From the second time use jekyll serve.
